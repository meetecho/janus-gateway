 * \brief    Audio/Video recorder (headers)
 * \details  Implementation of a simple recorder utility that plugins
 * can make use of to record audio/video frames to a Janus file. This
 * file just saves RTP frames in a structured way, so that they can be
 * post-processed later on to get a valid container file (e.g., a .opus
 * file for Opus audio or a .webm file for VP8 video) and keep things
 * simpler on the plugin and core side. Check the \ref recordings
 * documentation for more details.
 * \note If you want to record both audio and video, you'll have to use
 * two different recorders. Any muxing in the same container will have
 * to be done in the post-processing phase.
