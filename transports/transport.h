 * \brief  Modular Janus API transports
 * \details  This header contains the definition of the callbacks both
 * the gateway and all the transports need too implement to interact with
 * each other. The structures to make the communication possible are
 * defined here as well.
 * 
 * In particular, the gateway implements the \c janus_transport_callbacks
 * interface. This means that, as a transport plugin, you can use the
 * methods it exposes to contact the gateway, e.g., in order to notify
 * an incoming message. In particular, the methods the gateway exposes
 * to transport plugins are:
 * 
 * - \c incoming_request(): to notify an incoming JSON message/event 
 * from one of the transport clients.
 * 
 * On the other hand, a transport plugin that wants to register at the
 * gateway needs to implement the \c janus_transport interface. Besides,
 * as a transport plugin is a shared object, and as such external to the
 * gateway itself, in order to be dynamically loaded at startup it needs
 * to implement the \c create_t() hook as well, that should return a
 * pointer to the plugin instance. This is an example of such a step:
 * 
\verbatim
static janus_transport mytransport = {
	[..]
};

janus_transport *create(void) {
	JANUS_LOG(LOG_VERB, , "%s created!\n", MY_TRANSPORT_NAME);
	return &mytransport;
}
\endverbatim
 * 
 * This will make sure that your transport plugin is loaded at startup
 * by the gateway, if it is deployed in the proper folder.
 * 
 * As anticipated and described in the above example, a transport plugin
 * must basically be an instance of the \c janus_transport type. As such,
 * it must implement the following methods and callbacks for the gateway:
 * 
 * - \c init(): this is called by the gateway as soon as your transport
 * plugin is started; this is where you should setup your transport plugin
 * (e.g., static stuff and reading the configuration file);
 * - \c destroy(): on the other hand, this is called by the gateway when it
 * is shutting down, and your transport plugin should too;
 * - \c get_api_compatibility(): this method MUST return JANUS_TRANSPORT_API_VERSION;
 * - \c get_version(): this method should return a numeric version identifier (e.g., 3);
 * - \c get_version_string(): this method should return a verbose version identifier (e.g., "v1.0.1");
 * - \c get_description(): this method should return a verbose description of your transport plugin (e.g., "This is my avian carrier transport plugin for the Janus API");
 * - \c get_name(): this method should return a short display name for your transport plugin (e.g., "My Amazing Transport");
 * - \c get_package(): this method should return a unique package identifier for your transport plugin (e.g., "janus.transport.mytransport");
 * - \c is_janus_api_enabled(): this method should return TRUE if Janus API can be used with this transport, and support has been enabled by the user;
 * - \c is_admin_api_enabled(): this method should return TRUE if Admin API can be used with this transport, and support has been enabled by the user;
 * - \c send_message(): this method asks the transport to send a message (be it a response or an event) to a client on the specified transport;
 * - \c session_created(): this method notifies the transport that a Janus session has been created by one of its requests;
 * - \c session_over(): this method notifies the transport that one of its Janus sessionss is now over, whether because of a timeour or not.
 * 
 * All the above methods and callbacks are mandatory: the Janus core will
 * reject a transport plugin that doesn't implement any of the
 * mandatory callbacks.
 * 
 * The gateway \c janus_transport_callbacks interface is provided to a
 * transport plugin, together with the path to the configurations files
 * folder, in the \c init() method. This path can be used to read and
 * parse a configuration file for the transport plugin: the transport
 * plugins we made available out of the box use the package name as a
 * name for the file (e.g., \c janus.transport.http.cfg for the HTTP/HTTPS
 * transport plugin), but you're free to use a different one, as long
 * as it doesn't collide with existing ones. Besides, the existing transport
 * plugins use the same INI format for configuration files the gateway
 * uses (relying on the \c janus_config helpers for the purpose) but
 * again, if you prefer a different format (XML, JSON, etc.) that's up to you.
