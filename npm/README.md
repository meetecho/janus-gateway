Janus WebRTC Server (janus.js)
==============================

This is the npm version of `janus.js`, a JavaScript library to talk to the [Janus WebRTC Server](https://github.com/meetecho/janus-gateway). This is the only authorized version of `janus.js` on npm:

https://www.npmjs.com/package/janus-gateway

If you encounter other versions, they were not made nor uploaded by [Meetecho](https://www.meetecho.com), and so should be considered not trusted.

For information on how to use the library, please refer to the [official documentation](https://janus.conf.meetecho.com/docs/JS), which includes information on how to use `janus.js` as a module.

> **Note well**: please notice that `janus.js` is mostly meant as a convenience library for use in our Janus demos, and is not necessarily suited for production usages. For a more modern JavaScript and Node.js SDK to use with Janus, please refer to [Janode](https://www.npmjs.com/package/janode) instead.
