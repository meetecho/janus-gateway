; Configuration of the RabbitMQ additional transport for the Janus API.
; This is only useful when you're wrapping Janus requests in your server
; application, and handling the communication with clients your own way.
; At the moment, only a single "application" can be handled at the same
; time, meaning that Janus won't implement multiple queues to handle
; multiple concurrent "application servers" taking advantage of its
; features. Support for this is planned, though (e.g., through some kind
; of negotiation to create queues on the fly). Right now, you can only
; configure the address of the RabbitMQ server to use, and the queues to
; make use of to receive (to-janus) and send (from-janus) messages
; from/to an external application. If you're using the same RabbitMQ
; server instance for multiple Janus instances, make sure you configure
; different queues for each of them (e.g., from-janus-1/to-janus-1 and
; from-janus-2/to-janus-2), or otherwise both the instances will make
; use of the same queues and messages will get lost. The integration
; is disabled by default, so set enable=yes if you want to use it.

; If you want to expose the Admin API via RabbitMQ as well, you need to
