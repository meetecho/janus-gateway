# that lower values (e.g., 100ms) will typically get you faster connection

# NAT-related stuff: specifically, you can configure the STUN/TURN
# servers to use to gather candidates if the gateway is behind a NAT,
# and srflx/relay candidates are needed. In case STUN is not enough and
# this is needed (it shouldn't), you can also configure Janus to use a
# TURN server# please notice that this does NOT refer to TURN usage in
# browsers, but in the gathering of relay candidates by Janus itself,
# e.g., if you want to limit the ports used by a Janus instance on a
# private machine. Furthermore, you can choose whether Janus should be
# configured to do full-trickle (Janus also trickles its candidates to
# users) rather than the default half-trickle (Janus supports trickle
# candidates from users, but sends its own within the SDP), and whether
# it should work in ICE-Lite mode (by default it doesn't). If libnice is
# at least 0.1.15, you can choose which ICE nomination mode to use: valid
# values are "regular" and "aggressive" (the default depends on the libnice
# version itself; if we can set it, we set aggressive nomination). You can
# also configure whether to use connectivity checks as keep-alives, which
# might help detecting when a peer is no longer available (notice that
# current libnice master is breaking connections after 50 seconds when
# keepalive-conncheck is being used, so if you want to use it, better
# sticking to 0.1.18 until the issue is addressed upstream). Finally,
# you can also enable ICE-TCP support (beware that this may lead to problems
# if you do not enable ICE Lite as well), choose which interfaces should
# be used for gathering candidates, and enable or disable the
# internal libnice debugging, if needed.

	# such, use the option with caution and only if you know what you're doing.
	# Make sure you keep ICE Lite disabled, though, as it's not strictly
	# speaking a publicly reachable server, and a NAT is still involved.
	# If you'd rather keep the private IP address in place, rather than
	# replacing it (and so have both of them as advertised candidates),
	# then set the 'keep_private_host' property to true.

	# You can also choose which interfaces should be explicitly used by the
	# gateway for the purpose of ICE candidates gathering, thus excluding
	# others that may be available. To do so, use the 'ice_enforce_list'
	# setting and pass it a comma-separated list of interfaces or IP addresses
	# to enforce. This is especially useful if the server hosting the gateway
	# has several interfaces, and you only want a subset to be used. Any of

	#     ice_enforce_list = "eth0"
	#     ice_enforce_list = "eth0,eth1"
	#     ice_enforce_list = "eth0,192.168."

	# In case you don't want to specify specific interfaces to use, but would
	# rather tell Janus to use all the available interfaces except some that
	# you don't want to involve, you can also choose which interfaces or IP
	# addresses should be excluded and ignored by the gateway for the purpose
	# of ICE candidates gathering. To do so, use the 'ice_ignore_list' setting
	# and pass it a comma-separated list of interfaces or IP addresses to
	# ignore. This is especially useful if the server hosting the gateway
	# has several interfaces you already know will not be used or will simply
	# always slow down ICE (e.g., virtual interfaces created by VMware).
	# Partial strings are supported, which means that any of the following
	# examples are valid:
	#     ice_ignore_list = "vmnet8,192.168.0.1,10.0.0.1"
	#     ice_ignore_list = "vmnet,192.168."
	# Just beware that the ICE ignore list is not used if an enforce list
	# has been configured. By default, Janus ignores all interfaces whose
	# name starts with 'vmnet', to skip VMware interfaces:
	ice_ignore_list = "vmnet"

	# In case you want to allow Janus to start even if the configured STUN or TURN
	# server is unreachable, you can set 'ignore_unreachable_ice_server' to true.
	# WARNING: We do not recommend to ignore reachability problems, particularly
	# if you run Janus in the cloud. Before enabling this flag, make sure your
	# system is correctly configured and Janus starts after the network layer of
	# your machine is ready. Note that Linux distributions offer such directives.
