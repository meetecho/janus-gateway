									# Notice that, while cutting the number of threads

# finally how much time, in seconds, should pass with no media (audio or
# video) being received before Janus notifies you about this (default=1s,
# 0 disables these events entirely). Finally, if you're using BoringSSL
# you can customize the frequency of retransmissions: OpenSSL has a fixed
# value of 1 second (the default), while BoringSSL can override that. Notice
# that lower values (e.g., 100ms) will typically get you faster connection
# times, but may not work in case the RTT of the user is high: as such,
# you should pick a reasonable trade-off (usually 2*max expected RTT).

# NAT-related stuff: specifically, you can configure the STUN/TURN
# servers to use to gather candidates if the gateway is behind a NAT,

# this is needed (it shouldn't), you can also configure Janus to use a
# TURN server# please notice that this does NOT refer to TURN usage in
# browsers, but in the gathering of relay candidates by Janus itself,
# e.g., if you want to limit the ports used by a Janus instance on a
# private machine. Furthermore, you can choose whether Janus should be
# configured to do full-trickle (Janus also trickles its candidates to
# users) rather than the default half-trickle (Janus supports trickle
# candidates from users, but sends its own within the SDP), and whether
# it should work in ICE-Lite mode (by default it doesn't). Finally,
# you can also enable ICE-TCP support (beware that it currently *only*
# works if you enable ICE Lite as well), choose which interfaces should
# be used for gathering candidates, and enable or disable the
# internal libnice debugging, if needed.

	# In case you're deploying Janus on a server which is configured with
	# a 1:1 NAT (e.g., Amazon EC2), you might want to also specify the public
	# address of the machine using the setting below. This will result in
	# all host candidates (which normally have a private IP address) to
	# be rewritten with the public address provided in the settings. As
	# such, use the option with caution and only if you know what you're doing.
	# Make sure you keep ICE Lite disabled, though, as it's not strictly
	# speaking a publicly reachable server, and a NAT is still involved.
	#nat_1_1_mapping = "1.2.3.4"

	# You can configure a TURN server in two different ways: specifying a
	# statically configured TURN server, and thus provide the address of the
	# TURN server, the transport (udp/tcp/tls) to use, and a set of valid
	# credentials to authenticate...

	#turn_port = 3478

	#turn_user = "myuser"

	# ... or you can make use of the TURN REST API to get info on one or more
	# TURN services dynamically. This makes use of the proposed standard of
	# such an API (https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-uberti-behave-turn-rest-00)
	# which is currently available in both rfc5766-turn-server and coturn.
	# You enable this by specifying the address of your TURN REST API backend,
	# the HTTP method to use (GET or POST) and, if required, the API key Janus
	# must provide.

	# You can also choose which interfaces should be explicitly used by the
	# gateway for the purpose of ICE candidates gathering, thus excluding
	# others that may be available. To do so, use the 'ice_enforce_list'
	# setting and pass it a comma-separated list of interfaces or IP addresses
	# to enforce. This is especially useful if the server hosting the gateway
	# has several interfaces, and you only want a subset to be used. Any of
	# the following examples are valid:
	#     ice_enforce_list = "eth0"
	#     ice_enforce_list = "eth0,eth1"
	#     ice_enforce_list = "eth0,192.168."
	#     ice_enforce_list = "eth0,192.168.0.1"
	# By default, no interface is enforced, meaning Janus will try to use them all.
	#ice_enforce_list = "eth0"

	# In case you don't want to specify specific interfaces to use, but would
	# rather tell Janus to use all the available interfaces except some that
	# you don't want to involve, you can also choose which interfaces or IP
	# addresses should be excluded and ignored by the gateway for the purpose
	# of ICE candidates gathering. To do so, use the 'ice_ignore_list' setting
	# and pass it a comma-separated list of interfaces or IP addresses to
	# ignore. This is especially useful if the server hosting the gateway
	# has several interfaces you already know will not be used or will simply
	# always slow down ICE (e.g., virtual interfaces created by VMware).
	# Partial strings are supported, which means that any of the following
	# examples are valid:
	#     ice_ignore_list = "vmnet8,192.168.0.1,10.0.0.1"
	#     ice_ignore_list = "vmnet,192.168."
	# Just beware that the ICE ignore list is not used if an enforce list
	# has been configured. By default, Janus ignores all interfaces whose
	# name starts with 'vmnet', to skip VMware interfaces:
	ice_ignore_list = "vmnet"
}

# You can choose which of the available plugins should be
# enabled or not. Use the 'disable' directive to prevent Janus from
# loading one or more plugins: use a comma separated list of plugin file
# names to identify the plugins to disable. By default all available
# plugins are enabled and loaded at startup.
plugins: {
	#disable = "libjanus_voicemail.so,libjanus_recordplay.so"

# You can choose which of the available transports should be enabled or
# not. Use the 'disable' directive to prevent Janus from loading one
# or more transport: use a comma separated list of transport file names
# to identify the transports to disable. By default all available
# transports are enabled and loaded at startup.
transports: {
	#disable = "libjanus_rabbitmq.so"
}

# Event handlers allow you to receive live events from Janus happening
# in core and/or plugins. Since this can require some more resources,
# the feature is disabled by default. Setting broadcast to yes will
# enable them. You can then choose which of the available event handlers
# should be loaded or not. Use the 'disable' directive to prevent Janus
# from loading one or more event handlers: use a comma separated list of
# file names to identify the event handlers to disable. By default, if
# broadcast is set to yes all available event handlers are enabled and
# loaded at startup. Finally, you can choose how often media statistics
# (packets sent/received, losses, etc.) should be sent: by default it's
# once per second (audio and video statistics sent separately), but may
# considered too verbose, or you may want to limit the number of events,
# especially if you have many PeerConnections active. To change this,
# just set 'stats_period' to the number of seconds that should pass in
# between statistics for each handle. Setting it to 0 disables them (but
# not other media-related events).

	#broadcast = true
