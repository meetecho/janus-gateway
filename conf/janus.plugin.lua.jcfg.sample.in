# The only things you configure in here are which lua script to load and,
# optionally, the paths to add for searching libraries and a configuration
# file, if the script will need it. For what concerns the libraries path,
# by default this configuration file adds a path to where the Lua samples
# have been installed, as it contains a couple of helper libraries the
# samples use; should you be interested in adding more, just add other
# paths separated by a semicolon. Due to the syntax of the configuration
# file, make sure you escape all semicolons with a trailing slash, in case.
# The 'config' property is entirely script specific, instead: if your
# script will need to rely on an XML configuration file in its initialization,
# for instance, then set the 'config' property as the path to the file;
# it will be passed, as is, to your script in the init() call. None of
# the samples use this property, which is why it's commented out.
