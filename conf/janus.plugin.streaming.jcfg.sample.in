#
# In case you want to use SRTP for your RTP-based mountpoint, you'll need
# to configure the SRTP-related properties as well, namely the suite to
# use for hashing (32 or 80) and the crypto information for decrypting
# the stream (as a base64 encoded string the way SDES does it). Notice
# that with SRTP involved you'll have to pay extra attention to what you
# feed the mountpoint, as you may risk getting SRTP decrypt errors:
# srtpsuite = 32

# url = RTSP stream URL (only for restreaming RTSP)
# rtsp_user = RTSP authorization username (only if type=rtsp)
# rtsp_pwd = RTSP authorization password (only if type=rtsp)
# rtspiface = network interface or IP address to bind to, if any (binds to all otherwise), when receiving RTSP streams
# rtsp_failcheck = whether an error should be returned if connecting to the RTSP server fails (default=true)
#
# Notice that, for 'rtsp' mountpoints, normally the plugin uses the exact
# SDP rtpmap and fmtp attributes the remote camera or RTSP server sent.
# In case the values set remotely are known to conflict with WebRTC viewers,
# you can override both using the settings introduced above.
#
# To test the 'gstreamer-sample' example, check the test_gstreamer.sh

# All browsers also support H.264, often through Cisco's OpenH264 plugin.
# The only profile that is definitely supported is the baseline one, which
# means that if you try a higher one it might or might not work. No matter
# which profile you encode, though, you can put a custom one in the SDP if
# you override the fmtp SDP attribute via 'videofmtp'. The following is an
# example of how to create a simple H.264 mountpoint: you can feed it via
# an x264enc+rtph264pay pipeline in gstreamer, an ffmpeg script or other.

# The Streaming plugin also supports the broadcasting of datachannel
# messages, either by themselves or along other audio/video streams (e.g.,
# to add a subtitle to a stream you're sending). The following is an
# example of how you can create a datachannel-only mountpoint: you can
# feed it with any tool that can send UDP datagrams, e.g., netcat.
# Notice that the 'rtp' type just indicates this is a live mountpoint:
# datachannel messages will be sent as usual, and not use RTP at all.

# Again, you can override payload type, rtpmap and/or fmtp, if needed
