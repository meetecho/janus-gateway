; Web server and WebSockets stuff: whether either one should be enabled,
; which ports they should use, whether security should be handled directly
; or demanded to an external application (e.g., web frontend) and what
; should be the base path for the Janus API protocol (plain HTTP only).
; You can also specify the threading model to use for the HTTP webserver:
; by default this is 'unlimited' (which means a thread per connection, as
; specified by the libmicrohttpd documentation), using a number will make
; use of a thread pool instead. Since long polls are involved, make sure
; you choose a value that doesn't keep new connections waiting.
; Please beware that the WebSockets server will only be available if you
; built Janus compiling support for it.

; Recent versions of Janus now also support RabbitMQ based messaging as
; an alternative "transport" for API requests, responses and notifications.
; This is only useful when you're wrapping Janus requests in your server
; application, and handling the communication with clients your own way.
; At the moment, only a single "application" can be handled at the same
; time, meaning that Janus won't implement multiple queues to handle
; multiple concurrent "application servers" taking advantage of its
; features. Support for this is planned, though (e.g., through some kind
; of negotiation to create queues on the fly). Right now, you can only
; configure the address of the RabbitMQ server to use, and the queues to
; make use of to receive (to-janus) and send (from-janus) messages
; from/to an external application. If you're using the same RabbitMQ
; server instance for multiple Janus instances, make sure you configure
; different queues for each of them (e.g., from-janus-1/to-janus-1 and
; from-janus-2/to-janus-2), or otherwise both the instances will make
; use of the same queues and messages will get lost. The integration
; is disabled by default, so set enable=yes if you want to use it.

; Janus can also expose an admin/monitor endpoint, to allow you to check
; which sessions are up, which handles they're managing, their current
; status and so on. This provides a useful aid when debugging potential
; issues in Janus. The configuration is pretty much the same as the one
; already presented above for the webserver stuff, as the API is very
; similar: choose the base bath for the admin/monitor endpoint (/admin
; by default), ports, threading model, etc. Besides, you can specify
; a secret that must be provided in all requests as a crude form of
; authorization mechanism, and partial or full source IPs if you want to
; limit access basing on IP addresses. For security reasons, this
; endpoint is disabled by default, enable it by setting admin_http=yes.

; Media-related stuff: right now, you can only configure whether you want
; to enable IPv6 support (still WIP, so handle with care), the maximum size
; of the NACK queue for retransmissions per handle and the range of
; ports to use for RTP and RTCP (by default, no range is envisaged).
; If you change any setting in the lines below, remember to uncomment the
; [media] category as well, which is commented by default!

; NAT-related stuff: specifically, you can either manually specify the 
; public IP of the machine (i.e., what would be used in SDP) or
; configure the STUN server to use to gather candidates if the gateway
; is behind a NAT, and srflx candidates are needed. By default, this
; section is commented as the gateway is assumed to be deployed on a
; public network. When configuring the public IP or the STUN
; configuration, remember to uncomment the [nat] categoty line as well!
[nat]
;public_ip = 1.2.3.4
;stun_server = stun.voip.eutelia.it
;stun_port = 3478

; You can also choose which interfaces or IP addresses should be excluded
; and ignored by the gateway for the purpose of ICE candidates gathering.
; To do so, use the 'ice_ignore_list' setting and pass it a comma-separated
; list of interfaces or IP addresses to ignore. This is especially useful
; if the server hosting the gateway has several interfaces you already
; know will not be used or will simply always slow down ICE (e.g., virtual
; interfaces created by VMware). Partial strings are supported, which
; means that any of the following examples are valid:
;     ice_ignore_list = vmnet8,192.168.0.1,10.0.0.1
;     ice_ignore_list = vmnet,192.168.
; By default, we ignore all interfaces whose name starts with 'vmnet':
ice_ignore_list = vmnet
