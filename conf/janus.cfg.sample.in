; Web server and WebSockets stuff: whether either one should be enabled,
; which ports they should use, whether security should be handled directly
; or demanded to an external application (e.g., web frontend) and what
; should be the base path for the Janus API protocol (plain HTTP only).
; You can also specify the threading model to use for the HTTP webserver:
; by default this is 'unlimited' (which means a thread per connection, as
; specified by the libmicrohttpd documentation), using a number will make
; use of a thread pool instead. Since long polls are involved, make sure
; you choose a value that doesn't keep new connections waiting.
; Please beware that the WebSockets server will only be available if you
; built Janus compiling support for it.

; Recent versions of Janus now also support RabbitMQ based messaging as
; an alternative "transport" for API requests, responses and notifications.
; This is only useful when you're wrapping Janus requests in your server
; application, and handling the communication with clients your own way.
; At the moment, only a single "application" can be handled at the same
; time, meaning that Janus won't implement multiple queues to handle
; multiple concurrent "application servers" taking advantage of its
; features. Support for this is planned, though (e.g., through some kind
; of negotiation to create queues on the fly). Right now, you can only
; configure the address of the RabbitMQ server to use, and the queues to
; make use of to receive (to-janus) and send (from-janus) messages
; from/to an external application. If you're using the same RabbitMQ
; server instance for multiple Janus instances, make sure you configure
; different queues for each of them (e.g., from-janus-1/to-janus-1 and
; from-janus-2/to-janus-2), or otherwise both the instances will make
; use of the same queues and messages will get lost. The integration
; is disabled by default, so set enable=yes if you want to use it.

; Janus can also expose an admin/monitor endpoint, to allow you to check
; which sessions are up, which handles they're managing, their current
; status and so on. This provides a useful aid when debugging potential
; issues in Janus. The configuration is pretty much the same as the one
; already presented above for the webserver stuff, as the API is very
; similar: choose the base bath for the admin/monitor endpoint (/admin
; by default), ports, threading model, etc. Besides, you can specify
; a secret that must be provided in all requests as a crude form of
; authorization mechanism, and partial or full source IPs if you want to
; limit access basing on IP addresses. For security reasons, this
; endpoint is disabled by default, enable it by setting admin_http=yes.

; to enable IPv6 support (still WIP, so handle with care), the maximum size
; of the NACK queue for retransmissions per handle the range of ports to
; use for RTP and RTCP (by default, no range is envisaged) and the
; starting MTU for DTLS (1472 by default, it adapts automatically).

; NAT-related stuff: specifically, you can configure the STUN/TURN
; servers to use to gather candidates if the gateway is behind a NAT,
; and srflx/relay candidates are needed. In case STUN is not enough and
; this is needed (it shouldn't), you can also configure Janus to use a
; TURN server; please notice that this does NOT refer to TURN usage in
; browsers, but in the gathering of relay candidates by Janus itself,
; e.g., if you want to limit the ports used by a Janus instance on a
; private machine. Furthermore, you can choose whether Janus should be
; configured to work in ICE-Lite mode (by default it doesn't). Finally,
; you can also enable ICE-TCP support (beware that it currently *only*
; works if you enable ICE Lite as well), choose which interfaces should
; be used for gathering candidates, and enable or disable the
; internal libnice debugging, if needed.

; In case you're deploying Janus on a server which is configured with
; a 1:1 NAT (e.g., Amazon EC2), you might want to also specify the public
; address of the machine using the setting below. This will result in
; all host candidates (which normally have a private IP address) to
; be rewritten with the public address provided in the settings. As
; such, use the option with caution and only if you know what you're doing.
;nat_1_1_mapping = 1.2.3.4

; You can configure a TURN server in two different ways: specifying a
; statically configured TURN server, and thus provide the address of the
; TURN server, the transport (udp/tcp/tls) to use, and a set of valid
; credentials to authenticate...
;turn_server = myturnserver.com
;turn_port = 3478
;turn_type = udp
;turn_user = myuser
;turn_pwd = mypassword

; ... or you can make use of the TURN REST API to get info on one or more
; TURN services dynamically. This makes use of the proposed standard of
; such an API (https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-uberti-behave-turn-rest-00)
; which is currently available in both rfc5766-turn-server and coturn.
; You enable this by specifying the address of your TURN REST API backend
; and, if required, the API key Janus must provide.
;turn_rest_api = http://yourbackend.com/path/to/api
;turn_rest_api_key = anyapikeyyoumayhaveset

; You can also choose which interfaces should be explicitly used by the
; gateway for the purpose of ICE candidates gathering, thus excluding
; others that may be available. To do so, use the 'ice_enforce_list'
; setting and pass it a comma-separated list of interfaces or IP addresses
; to enforce. This is especially useful if the server hosting the gateway
; has several interfaces, and you only want a subset to be used. Any of
; the following examples are valid:
;     ice_enforce_list = eth0
;     ice_enforce_list = eth0,eth1
;     ice_enforce_list = eth0,192.168.
;     ice_enforce_list = eth0,192.168.0.1
; By default, no interface is enforced, meaning Janus will try to use them all.
;ice_enforce_list = eth0

; In case you don't want to specify specific interfaces to use, but would
; rather tell Janus to use all the available interfaces except some that
; you don't want to involve, you can also choose which interfaces or IP
; addresses should be excluded and ignored by the gateway for the purpose
; of ICE candidates gathering. To do so, use the 'ice_ignore_list' setting
; and pass it a comma-separated list of interfaces or IP addresses to
; ignore. This is especially useful if the server hosting the gateway
; has several interfaces you already know will not be used or will simply
; always slow down ICE (e.g., virtual interfaces created by VMware).
; Partial strings are supported, which means that any of the following
; examples are valid:
;     ice_ignore_list = vmnet8,192.168.0.1,10.0.0.1
;     ice_ignore_list = vmnet,192.168.
; Just beware that the ICE ignore list is not used if an enforce list
; has been configured. By default, Janus ignores all interfaces whose
; name starts with 'vmnet', to skip VMware interfaces:
ice_ignore_list = vmnet

; Finally, you can choose which of the available plugins should be
; enabled or not. Use the 'disable' directive to prevent Janus from
; loading one or more plugins: use a comma separated list of plugin file
; names to identify the plugins to disable. By default all available
; plugins are enabled and loaded at startup.
