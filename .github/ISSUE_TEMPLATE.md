> 2. nobody opened the same bug already (do a search);
> 3. the issue wasn't already solved in master;
> 4. you don't paste a huge amount of text in the issue or comments: use a service like [pastebin](http://pastebin.com/) or similar;
> 5. you provide a GDB stacktrace if Janus crashed on you, and/or output from AddressSanitizer or Valgrind (more details available [here](http://janus.conf.meetecho.com/docs/debug.html)).
