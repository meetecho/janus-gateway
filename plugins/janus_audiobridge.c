 * \brief  Janus AudioBridge plugin
 * \details  This is a plugin implementing an audio conference bridge for
 * Janus, specifically mixing Opus streams. This means that it replies
 * by providing in the SDP only support for Opus, and disabling video.
 * Opus encoding and decoding is implemented using libopus (http://opus.codec.org).
 * The plugin provides an API to allow peers to join and leave conference
 * rooms. Peers can then mute/unmute themselves by sending specific messages
 * to the plugin: any way a peer mutes/unmutes, an event is triggered
 * to the other participants, so that it can be rendered in the UI
 * accordingly.
 * 
 * Rooms to make available are listed in the plugin configuration file.
 * A pre-filled configuration file is provided in \c conf/janus.plugin.audiobridge.cfg
 * and includes a demo room for testing.
 * 
 * To add more rooms or modify the existing one, you can use the following
 * syntax:
 * 
 * \verbatim
[<unique room ID>]
description = This is my awesome room
is_private = yes|no (private rooms don't appear when you do a 'list' request)
secret = <optional password needed for manipulating (e.g. destroying) the room>
pin = <optional password needed for joining the room>
sampling_rate = <sampling rate> (e.g., 16000 for wideband mixing)
record = true|false (whether this room should be recorded, default=false)
record_file =	/path/to/recording.wav (where to save the recording)
\endverbatim

 * \section bridgeapi Audio Bridge API
 * 
 * The Audio Bridge API supports several requests, some of which are
 * synchronous and some asynchronous. There are some situations, though,
 * (invalid JSON, invalid request) which will always result in a
 * synchronous error response even for asynchronous requests. 
 * 
 * \c create , \c destroy , \c exists, \c list, \c listparticipants
 * and \c resetdecoder are synchronous requests, which means you'll
 * get a response directly within the context of the transaction.
 * \c create allows you to create a new audio conference bridge
 * dynamically, as an alternative to using the configuration file;
 * \c destroy removes an audio conference bridge and destroys it, kicking
 * all the users out as part of the process; \c exists allows you to
 * check whether a specific audio conference exists; \c list
 * lists all the available rooms, while \c listparticipants lists all
 * the participants of a specific room and their details; finally,
 * \c resetdecoder marks the Opus decoder for the participant as invalid,
 * and forces it to be recreated (which might be needed if the audio
 * for generated by the participant becomes garbled). 
 * 
 * The \c join , \c configure , \c changeroom and \c leave requests
 * instead are all asynchronous, which means you'll get a notification
 * about their success or failure in an event. \c join allows you to
 * join a specific audio conference bridge; \c configure can be used
 * to modify some of the participation settings (e.g., mute/unmute);
 * \c changeroom can be used to leave the current room and move to a
 * different one without having to tear down the PeerConnection and
 * recreate it again (useful for sidebars and "waiting rooms"); finally,
 * \c leave allows you to leave an audio conference bridge for good.
 * 
 * \c create can be used to create a new audio room, and has to be
 * formatted as follows:
 * 
\verbatim
{
	"request" : "create",
	"room" : <unique numeric ID, optional, chosen by plugin if missing>,
	"permanent" : <true|false, whether the room should be saved in the config file, default false>,
	"description" : "<pretty name of the room, optional>",
	"secret" : "<password required to edit/destroy the room, optional>",
	"pin" : "<password required to join the room, optional>",
	"is_private" : <true|false, whether the room should appear in a list request>,
	"sampling" : <sampling rate of the room, optional, 16000 by default>,
	"record" : <true|false, whether to record the room or not, default false>,
	"record_file" : "</path/to/the/recording.wav, optional>",
}
\endverbatim
 *
 * A successful creation procedure will result in a \c created response:
 * 
\verbatim
{
	"audiobridge" : "created",
	"room" : <unique numeric ID>
}
\endverbatim
 *
 * An error instead (and the same applies to all other requests, so this
 * won't be repeated) would provide both an error code and a more verbose
 * description of the cause of the issue:
 * 
\verbatim
{
	"audiobridge" : "event",
	"error_code" : <numeric ID, check Macros below>,
	"error" : "<error description as a string>"
}
\endverbatim
 * 
 * On the other hand, \c destroy can be used to destroy an existing audio
 * room, whether created dynamically or statically, and has to be
 * formatted as follows:
 * 
\verbatim
{
	"request" : "destroy",
	"room" : <unique numeric ID of the room to destroy>,
	"secret" : "<room secret, mandatory if configured>",
	"permanent" : <true|false, whether the room should be also removed from the config file, default false>
}
\endverbatim
 *
 * A successful destruction procedure will result in a \c destroyed response:
 * 
\verbatim
{
	"audiobridge" : "created",
	"room" : <unique numeric ID>
}
\endverbatim
 *
 * You can check whether a room exists using the \c exists request,
 * which has to be formatted as follows:
 * 
\verbatim
{
	"request" : "exists",
	"room" : <unique numeric ID of the room to check>
}
\endverbatim
 *
 * A successful request will result in a \c success response:
 * 
\verbatim
{
	"audiobridge" : "success",
	"room" : <unique numeric ID>,
	"exists" : <true|false>
}
\endverbatim
 * 
 * To get a list of the available rooms (excluded those configured or
 * created as private rooms) you can make use of the \c list request,
 * which has to be formatted as follows:
 * 
\verbatim
{
	"request" : "list"
}
\endverbatim
 *
 * A successful request will produce a list of rooms in a \c success response:
 * 
\verbatim
{
	"audiobridge" : "success",
	"rooms" : [		// Array of room objects
		{	// Room #1
			"room" : <unique numeric ID>,
			"description" : "<Name of the room>",
			"sampling_rate" : <sampling rate of the mixer>,
			"record" : <true|false, whether the room is being recorded>,
			"num_participants" : <count of the participants>
		},
		// Other rooms
	]
}
\endverbatim
 *
 * To get a list of the participants in a specific room, instead, you
 * can make use of the \c listparticipants request, which has to be
 * formatted as follows:
 * 
\verbatim
{
	"request" : "listparticipants",
	"room" : <unique numeric ID of the room>
}
\endverbatim
 *
 * A successful request will produce a list of participants in a
 * \c participants response:
 * 
\verbatim
{
	"audiobridge" : "participants",
	"room" : <unique numeric ID of the room>,
	"participants" : [		// Array of participant objects
		{	// Participant #1
			"id" : <unique numeric ID of the participant>,
			"display" : "<display name of the participant, if any; optional>",
			"muted" : <true|false, whether user is muted or not>
		},
		// Other participants
	]
}
\endverbatim
 * 
 * To mark the Opus decoder context for the current participant as
 * invalid and force it to be recreated, use the \c resetdecoder request:
 * 
\verbatim
{
	"request" : "resetdecoder"
}
\endverbatim
 *
 * A successful request will produce a \c success response:
 * 
\verbatim
{
	"audiobridge" : "success"
}
\endverbatim
 * 
 * That completes the list of synchronous requests you can send to the
 * AudioBridge plugin. As anticipated, though, there are also several
 * asynchronous requests you can send, specifically those related to
 * joining and updating one's presence as a participant in an audio room.
 * 
 * The way you'd interact with the plugin is usually as follows:
 * 
 * -# you use a \c join request to join an audio room, and wait for the
 * \c joined event; this event will also include a list of the other
 * participants, if any;
 * -# you send a \c configure request attached to an audio-only JSEP offer
 * to start configuring your participation in the room (e.g., join unmuted
 * or muted), and wait for a \c configured event, which will be attached
 * to a JSEP answer by the plugin to complete the setup of the WebRTC
 * PeerConnection;
 * -# you send other \c configure requests (without any JSEP-related
 * attachment) to mute/unmute yourself during the audio conference;
 * -# you intercept events originated by the plugin (\c joined , \c leaving )
 * to notify you about users joining/leaving/muting/unmuting;
 * -# you eventually send a \c leave request to leave a room; if you leave the
 * PeerConnection instance intact, you can subsequently join a different
 * room without requiring a new negotiation (and so just use a \c join + JSEP-less \c configure to join).
 * 
 * Notice that there's also a \c changeroom request available: you can use
 * this request to immediately leave the room you're in and join a different
 * one, without requiring you to do a \c leave + \c join + \c configure
 * round. Of course remember not to pass any JSEP-related payload when
 * doing a \c changeroom as the same pre-existing PeerConnection will be
 * re-used for the purpose.
 * 
 * About the syntax of all the above mentioned requests, \c join has
 * to be formatted as follows:
 * 
\verbatim
{
	"request" : "join",
	"room" : <numeric ID of the room to join>,
	"id" : <unique ID to assign to the participant; optional, assigned by the plugin if missing>,
	"pin" : "<password required to join the room, if any; optional>",
	"display" : "<display name to have in the room; optional>",
	"muted" : <true|false, whether to start unmuted or muted>,
	"quality" : <0-10, Opus-related complexity to use, lower is higher quality; optional, default is 4>
}
\endverbatim
 *
 * A successful request will produce a \c joined event:
 * 
\verbatim
{
	"audiobridge" : "joined",
	"room" : <numeric ID of the room>,
	"id" : <unique ID assigned to the participant>,
	"display" : "<display name of the new participant>",
	"participants" : [
		// Array of existing participants in the room
	]
}
\endverbatim
 * 
 * The other participants in the room will be notified about the new
 * participant by means of a different \c joined event, which will only
 * include the \c room and the new participant as the only object in
 * a \c participants array.
 *
 * At this point, the media-related settings of the participant can be
 * modified by means of a \c configure request. The \c configure request
 * has to be formatted as follows:
 *
\verbatim
{
	"request" : "configure",
	"muted" : <true|false, whether to unmute or mute>,
	"quality" : <0-10, Opus-related complexity to use, lower is higher quality; optional, default is 4>,
}
\endverbatim
 *
 * \c muted instructs the plugin to mute or unmute the participant;
 * \c quality changes the complexity of the Opus encoder for the
 * participant. A successful request will result in a \c ok event:
 * 
\verbatim
{
	"audiobridge" : "event",
	"room" : <numeric ID of the room>,
	"result" : "ok"
}
\endverbatim
 *
 * In case the \c muted property was modified, the other participants in
 * the room will be notified about this by means of a \c event notification,
 * which will only include the \c room and the updated participant as the
 * only object in a \c participants array.
 *
 * As anticipated, you can leave an audio room using the \c leave request,
 * which has to be formatted as follows:
 * 
\verbatim
{
	"request" : "leave"
}
\endverbatim
 * 
 * All the participants will receive an \c event notification with the
 * ID of the participant who just left:
 * 
\verbatim
{
	"audiobridge" : "event",
	"room" : <numeric ID of the room>,
	"leaving" : <numeric ID of the participant who left>
}
\endverbatim
 *
 * For what concerns the \c changeroom request, instead, it's pretty much
 * the same as a \c join request and as such has to be formatted as follows:
 * 
\verbatim
{
	"request" : "changeroom",
	"room" : <numeric ID of the room to move to>,
	"id" : <unique ID to assign to the participant; optional, assigned by the plugin if missing>,
	"display" : "<display name to have in the room; optional>",
	"muted" : <true|false, whether to start unmuted or muted>,
	"quality" : <0-10, Opus-related complexity to use, lower is higher quality; optional, default is 4>
}
\endverbatim
 * 
 * Such a request will trigger all the above-described leaving/joined
 * events to the other participants, as it is indeed wrapping a \c leave
 * followed by a \c join and as such the other participants in both rooms
 * need to be updated accordingly. The participant who switched room
 * instead will be sent a \c roomchanged event which is pretty similar
 * to what \c joined looks like:
 * 
 * A successful request will produce a \c joined event:
 * 
\verbatim
{
	"audiobridge" : "roomchanged",
	"room" : <numeric ID of the new room>,
	"id" : <unique ID assigned to the participant in the new room>,
	"display" : "<display name of the new participant>",
	"participants" : [
		// Array of existing participants in the new room
	]
}
\endverbatim
