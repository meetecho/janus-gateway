 * This is a plugin implementing an audio conference bridge for
 * Janus, specifically mixing Opus streams. This means that it replies
 * by providing in the SDP only support for Opus, and disabling video.
 * Opus encoding and decoding is implemented using libopus (http://opus.codec.org).
 * The plugin provides an API to allow peers to join and leave conference
 * rooms. Peers can then mute/unmute themselves by sending specific messages
 * to the plugin: any way a peer mutes/unmutes, an event is triggered
 * to the other participants, so that it can be rendered in the UI
 * accordingly.
 *
 * Rooms to make available are listed in the plugin configuration file.
 * A pre-filled configuration file is provided in \c conf/janus.plugin.audiobridge.jcfg
 * and includes a demo room for testing.
 *
 * To add more rooms or modify the existing one, you can use the following
 * syntax:
 *
 * \verbatim
room-<unique room ID>: {
	description = This is my awesome room
	is_private = true|false (private rooms don't appear when you do a 'list' request)
	secret = <optional password needed for manipulating (e.g. destroying) the room>
	pin = <optional password needed for joining the room>
	sampling_rate = <sampling rate> (e.g., 16000 for wideband mixing)
	audiolevel_ext = true|false (whether the ssrc-audio-level RTP extension must be
		negotiated/used or not for new joins, default=true)
	audiolevel_event = true|false (whether to emit event to other users or not, default=false)
	audio_active_packets = 100 (number of packets with audio level, default=100, 2 seconds)
	audio_level_average = 25 (average value of audio level, 127=muted, 0='too loud', default=25)
	record = true|false (whether this room should be recorded, default=false)
	record_file =	/path/to/recording.wav (where to save the recording)

		[The following lines are only needed if you want the mixed audio
		to be automatically forwarded via plain RTP to an external component
		(e.g., an ffmpeg script, or a gstreamer pipeline) for processing.
		By default plain RTP is used, SRTP must be configured if needed]
	rtp_forward_id = numeric RTP forwarder ID for referencing it via API (optional: random ID used if missing)
	rtp_forward_host = host address to forward RTP packets of mixed audio to
	rtp_forward_host_family = ipv4|ipv6; by default, first family returned by DNS request
	rtp_forward_port = port to forward RTP packets of mixed audio to
	rtp_forward_ssrc = SSRC to use to use when streaming (optional: stream_id used if missing)
	rtp_forward_ptype = payload type to use when streaming (optional: 100 used if missing)
	rtp_forward_srtp_suite = length of authentication tag, if SRTP is needed (32 or 80)
	rtp_forward_srtp_crypto = key to use as crypto, if SRTP is needed (base64 encoded key as in SDES)
	rtp_forward_always_on = true|false, whether silence should be forwarded when the room is empty (optional: false used if missing)
}

 * \section bridgeapi Audio Bridge API
 *
 * The Audio Bridge API supports several requests, some of which are
 * synchronous and some asynchronous. There are some situations, though,
 * (invalid JSON, invalid request) which will always result in a
 * synchronous error response even for asynchronous requests.
 *
 * \c create , \c edit , \c destroy , \c exists, \c allowed, \c kick, \c list,
 * \c listparticipants and \c resetdecoder are synchronous requests,
 * which means you'll get a response directly within the context of the
 * transaction. \c create allows you to create a new audio conference bridge
 * dynamically, as an alternative to using the configuration file; \c edit
 * allows you to dynamically edit some room properties (e.g., the PIN);
 * \c destroy removes an audio conference bridge and destroys it, kicking
 * all the users out as part of the process; \c exists allows you to
 * check whether a specific audio conference exists; \c allowed allows
 * you to edit who's allowed to join a room via ad-hoc tokens; \c list
 * lists all the available rooms, while \c listparticipants lists all
 * the participants of a specific room and their details; finally,
 * \c resetdecoder marks the Opus decoder for the participant as invalid,
 * and forces it to be recreated (which might be needed if the audio
 * for generated by the participant becomes garbled).
 *
 * The \c join , \c configure , \c changeroom and \c leave requests
 * instead are all asynchronous, which means you'll get a notification
 * about their success or failure in an event. \c join allows you to
 * join a specific audio conference bridge; \c configure can be used
 * to modify some of the participation settings (e.g., mute/unmute);
 * \c changeroom can be used to leave the current room and move to a
 * different one without having to tear down the PeerConnection and
 * recreate it again (useful for sidebars and "waiting rooms"); finally,
 * \c leave allows you to leave an audio conference bridge for good.
 *
 * The AudioBridge plugin also allows you to forward the mix to an
 * external listener, e.g., a gstreamer/ffmpeg pipeline waiting to
 * process the mixer audio stream. You can add new RTP forwarders with
 * the \c rtp_forward request; a \c stop_rtp_forward request removes an
 * existing RTP forwarder; \c listforwarders lists all the current RTP
 * forwarders on a specific AudioBridge room instance. As an alternative,
 * you can configure a single static RTP forwarder in the plugin
 * configuration file.
 *
 * \c create can be used to create a new audio room, and has to be
 * formatted as follows:
 *
\verbatim
{
	"request" : "create",
	"room" : <unique numeric ID, optional, chosen by plugin if missing>,
	"permanent" : <true|false, whether the room should be saved in the config file, default=false>,
	"description" : "<pretty name of the room, optional>",
	"secret" : "<password required to edit/destroy the room, optional>",
	"pin" : "<password required to join the room, optional>",
	"is_private" : <true|false, whether the room should appear in a list request>,
	"allowed" : [ array of string tokens users can use to join this room, optional],
	"sampling_rate" : <sampling rate of the room, optional, 16000 by default>,
	"audiolevel_ext" : <true|false, whether the ssrc-audio-level RTP extension must be negotiated for new joins, default=true>,
	"audiolevel_event" : true|false (whether to emit event to other users or not),
	"audio_active_packets" : 100 (number of packets with audio level, default=100, 2 seconds),
	"audio_level_average" : 25 (average value of audio level, 127=muted, 0='too loud', default=25),
	"record" : <true|false, whether to record the room or not, default=false>,
	"record_file" : "</path/to/the/recording.wav, optional>",
}
\endverbatim
 *
 * A successful creation procedure will result in a \c created response:
 *
\verbatim
{
	"audiobridge" : "created",
	"room" : <unique numeric ID>,
	"permanent" : <true if saved to config file, false if not>
}
\endverbatim
 *
 * If you requested a permanent room but a \c false value is returned
 * instead, good chances are that there are permission problems.
 *
 * An error instead (and the same applies to all other requests, so this
 * won't be repeated) would provide both an error code and a more verbose
 * description of the cause of the issue:
 *
\verbatim
{
	"audiobridge" : "event",
	"error_code" : <numeric ID, check Macros below>,
	"error" : "<error description as a string>"
}
\endverbatim
 *
 * Notice that, in general, all users can create rooms. If you want to
 * limit this functionality, you can configure an admin \c admin_key in
 * the plugin settings. When configured, only "create" requests that
 * include the correct \c admin_key value in an "admin_key" property
 * will succeed, and will be rejected otherwise. Notice that you can
 * optionally extend this functionality to RTP forwarding as well, in
 * order to only allow trusted clients to use that feature.
 *
 * Once a room has been created, you can still edit some (but not all)
 * of its properties using the \c edit request. This allows you to modify
 * the room description, secret, pin and whether it's private or not: you
 * won't be able to modify other more static properties, like the room ID,
 * the sampling rate, the extensions-related stuff and so on. If you're
 * interested in changing the ACL, instead, check the \c allowed message.
 * An \c edit request has to be formatted as follows:
 *
\verbatim
{
	"request" : "edit",
	"room" : <unique numeric ID of the room to edit>,
	"secret" : "<room secret, mandatory if configured>",
	"new_description" : "<new pretty name of the room, optional>",
	"new_secret" : "<new password required to edit/destroy the room, optional>",
	"new_pin" : "<new password required to join the room, optional>",
	"new_is_private" : <true|false, whether the room should appear in a list request>,
	"permanent" : <true|false, whether the room should be also removed from the config file, default=false>
}
\endverbatim
 *
 * A successful edit procedure will result in an \c edited response:
 *
\verbatim
{
	"audiobridge" : "edited",
	"room" : <unique numeric ID>
}
\endverbatim
 *
 * On the other hand, \c destroy can be used to destroy an existing audio
 * room, whether created dynamically or statically, and has to be
 * formatted as follows:
 *
\verbatim
{
	"request" : "destroy",
	"room" : <unique numeric ID of the room to destroy>,
	"secret" : "<room secret, mandatory if configured>",
	"permanent" : <true|false, whether the room should be also removed from the config file, default=false>
}
\endverbatim
 *
 * A successful destruction procedure will result in a \c destroyed response:
 *
\verbatim
{
	"audiobridge" : "destroyed",
	"room" : <unique numeric ID>
}
\endverbatim
 *
 * This will also result in a \c destroyed event being sent to all the
 * participants in the audio room, which will look like this:
 *
\verbatim
{
	"audiobridge" : "destroyed",
	"room" : <unique numeric ID of the destroyed room>
}
\endverbatim
 *
 * You can check whether a room exists using the \c exists request,
 * which has to be formatted as follows:
 *
\verbatim
{
	"request" : "exists",
	"room" : <unique numeric ID of the room to check>
}
\endverbatim
 *
 * A successful request will result in a \c success response:
 *
\verbatim
{
	"audiobridge" : "success",
	"room" : <unique numeric ID>,
	"exists" : <true|false>
}
\endverbatim
 *
 * You can configure whether to check tokens or add/remove people who can join
 * a room using the \c allowed request, which has to be formatted as follows:
 *
\verbatim
{
	"request" : "allowed",
	"secret" : "<room secret, mandatory if configured>",
	"action" : "enable|disable|add|remove",
	"room" : <unique numeric ID of the room to update>,
	"allowed" : [
		// Array of strings (tokens users might pass in "join", only for add|remove)
	]
}
\endverbatim
 *
 * A successful request will result in a \c success response:
 *
\verbatim
{
	"audiobridge" : "success",
	"room" : <unique numeric ID>,
	"allowed" : [
		// Updated, complete, list of allowed tokens (only for enable|add|remove)
	]
}
\endverbatim
 *
 * If you're the administrator of a room (that is, you created it and have access
 * to the secret) you can kick participants using the \c kick request. Notice
 * that this only kicks the user out of the room, but does not prevent them from
 * re-joining: to ban them, you need to first remove them from the list of
 * authorized users (see \c allowed request) and then \c kick them. The \c kick
 * request has to be formatted as follows:
 *
\verbatim
{
	"request" : "kick",
	"secret" : "<room secret, mandatory if configured>",
	"room" : <unique numeric ID of the room>,
	"id" : <unique numeric ID of the participant to kick>
}
\endverbatim
 *
 * A successful request will result in a \c success response:
 *
\verbatim
{
	"audiobridge" : "success",
}
\endverbatim
 *
 * To get a list of the available rooms (excluded those configured or
 * created as private rooms) you can make use of the \c list request,
 * which has to be formatted as follows:
 *
\verbatim
{
	"request" : "list"
}
\endverbatim
 *
 * A successful request will produce a list of rooms in a \c success response:
 *
\verbatim
{
	"audiobridge" : "success",
	"rooms" : [		// Array of room objects
		{	// Room #1
			"room" : <unique numeric ID>,
			"description" : "<Name of the room>",
			"pin_required" : <true|false, whether a PIN is required to join this room>,
			"sampling_rate" : <sampling rate of the mixer>,
			"record" : <true|false, whether the room is being recorded>,
			"num_participants" : <count of the participants>
		},
		// Other rooms
	]
}
\endverbatim
 *
 * To get a list of the participants in a specific room, instead, you
 * can make use of the \c listparticipants request, which has to be
 * formatted as follows:
 *
\verbatim
{
	"request" : "listparticipants",
	"room" : <unique numeric ID of the room>
}
\endverbatim
 *
 * A successful request will produce a list of participants in a
 * \c participants response:
 *
\verbatim
{
	"audiobridge" : "participants",
	"room" : <unique numeric ID of the room>,
	"participants" : [		// Array of participant objects
		{	// Participant #1
			"id" : <unique numeric ID of the participant>,
			"display" : "<display name of the participant, if any; optional>",
			"setup" : <true|false, whether user successfully negotiate a WebRTC PeerConnection or not>,
			"muted" : <true|false, whether user is muted or not>,
			"talking" : <true|false, whether user is talking or not (only if audio levels are used)>,
		},
		// Other participants
	]
}
\endverbatim
 *
 * To mark the Opus decoder context for the current participant as
 * invalid and force it to be recreated, use the \c resetdecoder request:
 *
\verbatim
{
	"request" : "resetdecoder"
}
\endverbatim
 *
 * A successful request will produce a \c success response:
 *
\verbatim
{
	"audiobridge" : "success"
}
\endverbatim
 *
 * You can add a new RTP forwarder for an existing room using the
 * \c rtp_forward request, which has to be formatted as follows:
 *
\verbatim
{
	"request" : "rtp_forward",
	"room" : <unique numeric ID of the room to add the forwarder to>,
	"ssrc" : <SSRC to use to use when streaming (optional: stream_id used if missing)>,
	"ptype" : <payload type to use when streaming (optional: 100 used if missing)>,
	"host" : "<host address to forward the RTP packets to>",
	"host_family" : "<ipv4|ipv6, if we need to resolve the host address to an IP; by default, whatever we get>",
	"port" : <port to forward the RTP packets to>,
	"srtp_suite" : <length of authentication tag (32 or 80); optional>,
	"srtp_crypto" : "<key to use as crypto (base64 encoded key as in SDES); optional>",
	"always_on" : <true|false, whether silence should be forwarded when the room is empty>
}
\endverbatim
 *
 * Notice that, as explained above, in case you configured an \c admin_key
 * property and extended it to RTP forwarding as well, you'll need to provide
 * it in the request as well or it will be rejected as unauthorized. By
 * default no limitation is posed on \c rtp_forward .
 *
 * A successful request will result in a \c success response:
 *
\verbatim
{
	"audiobridge" : "success",
	"room" : <unique numeric ID, same as request>,
	"stream_id" : <unique numeric ID assigned to the new RTP forwarder>,
	"host" : "<host this forwarder is streaming to, same as request if not resolved>",
	"port" : <audio port this forwarder is streaming to, same as request>
}
\endverbatim
 *
 * To stop a previously created RTP forwarder and stop it, you can use
 * the \c stop_rtp_forward request, which has to be formatted as follows:
 *
\verbatim
{
	"request" : "stop_rtp_forward",
	"room" : <unique numeric ID of the room to remove the forwarder from>,
	"stream_id" : <unique numeric ID of the RTP forwarder>
}
\endverbatim
 *
 * A successful request will result in a \c success response:
 *
\verbatim
{
	"audiobridge" : "success",
	"room" : <unique numeric ID, same as request>,
	"stream_id" : <unique numeric ID, same as request>
}
\endverbatim
 *
 * To get a list of the forwarders in a specific room, instead, you
 * can make use of the \c listforwarders request, which has to be
 * formatted as follows:
 *
\verbatim
{
	"request" : "listforwarders",
	"room" : <unique numeric ID of the room>
}
\endverbatim
 *
 * A successful request will produce a list of RTP forwarders in a
 * \c forwarders response:
 *
\verbatim
{
	"audiobridge" : "forwarders",
	"room" : <unique numeric ID of the room>,
	"rtp_forwarders" : [		// Array of RTP forwarder objects
		{	// RTP forwarder #1
			"stream_id" : <unique numeric ID of the forwarder>,
			"ip" : "<IP this forwarder is streaming to>",
			"port" : <port this forwarder is streaming to>,
			"ssrc" : <SSRC this forwarder is using, if any>,
			"ptype" : <payload type this forwarder is using, if any>,
			"srtp" : <true|false, whether the RTP stream is encrypted>,
			"always_on" : <true|false, whether this forwarder works even when no participant is in or not>
		},
		// Other forwarders
	]
}
\endverbatim
 *
 * That completes the list of synchronous requests you can send to the
 * AudioBridge plugin. As anticipated, though, there are also several
 * asynchronous requests you can send, specifically those related to
 * joining and updating one's presence as a participant in an audio room.
 *
 * The way you'd interact with the plugin is usually as follows:
 *
 * -# you use a \c join request to join an audio room, and wait for the
 * \c joined event; this event will also include a list of the other
 * participants, if any;
 * -# you send a \c configure request attached to an audio-only JSEP offer
 * to start configuring your participation in the room (e.g., join unmuted
 * or muted), and wait for a \c configured event, which will be attached
 * to a JSEP answer by the plugin to complete the setup of the WebRTC
 * PeerConnection;
 * -# you send other \c configure requests (without any JSEP-related
 * attachment) to mute/unmute yourself during the audio conference;
 * -# you intercept events originated by the plugin (\c joined , \c leaving )
 * to notify you about users joining/leaving/muting/unmuting;
 * -# you eventually send a \c leave request to leave a room; if you leave the
 * PeerConnection instance intact, you can subsequently join a different
 * room without requiring a new negotiation (and so just use a \c join + JSEP-less \c configure to join).
 *
 * Notice that there's also a \c changeroom request available: you can use
 * this request to immediately leave the room you're in and join a different
 * one, without requiring you to do a \c leave + \c join + \c configure
 * round. Of course remember not to pass any JSEP-related payload when
 * doing a \c changeroom as the same pre-existing PeerConnection will be
 * re-used for the purpose.
 *
 * About the syntax of all the above mentioned requests, \c join has
 * to be formatted as follows:
 *
\verbatim
{
	"request" : "join",
	"room" : <numeric ID of the room to join>,
	"id" : <unique ID to assign to the participant; optional, assigned by the plugin if missing>,
	"pin" : "<password required to join the room, if any; optional>",
	"display" : "<display name to have in the room; optional>",
	"token" : "<invitation token, in case the room has an ACL; optional>",
	"muted" : <true|false, whether to start unmuted or muted>,
	"quality" : <0-10, Opus-related complexity to use, the higher the value, the better the quality (but more CPU); optional, default is 4>,
	"volume" : <percent value, <100 reduces volume, >100 increases volume; optional, default is 100 (no volume change)>
}
\endverbatim
 *
 * A successful request will produce a \c joined event:
 *
\verbatim
{
	"audiobridge" : "joined",
	"room" : <numeric ID of the room>,
	"id" : <unique ID assigned to the participant>,
	"display" : "<display name of the new participant>",
	"participants" : [
		// Array of existing participants in the room
	]
}
\endverbatim
 *
 * The other participants in the room will be notified about the new
 * participant by means of a different \c joined event, which will only
 * include the \c room and the new participant as the only object in
 * a \c participants array.
 *
 * At this point, the media-related settings of the participant can be
 * modified by means of a \c configure request. The \c configure request
 * has to be formatted as follows (notice that all parameters except
 * \c request are optional, depending on what you want to change):
 *
\verbatim
{
	"request" : "configure",
	"muted" : <true|false, whether to unmute or mute>,
	"display" : "<new display name to have in the room>",
	"quality" : <0-10, Opus-related complexity to use, lower is higher quality; optional, default is 4>,
	"volume" : <percent value, <100 reduces volume, >100 increases volume; optional, default is 100 (no volume change)>,
	"record": <true|false, whether to record this user's contribution to a .mjr file (mixer not involved),
	"filename": "<basename of the file to record to, -audio.mjr will be added by the plugin>"
}
\endverbatim
 *
 * \c muted instructs the plugin to mute or unmute the participant;
 * \c quality changes the complexity of the Opus encoder for the
 * participant; \c record can be used to record this participant's contribution
 * to a Janus .mjr file, and \c filename to provide a basename for the path to
 * save the file to (notice that this is different from the recording of a whole
 * room: this feature only records the packets this user is sending, and is not
 * related to the mixer stuff). A successful request will result in a \c ok event:
 *
\verbatim
{
	"audiobridge" : "event",
	"room" : <numeric ID of the room>,
	"result" : "ok"
}
\endverbatim
 *
 * In case the \c muted property was modified, the other participants in
 * the room will be notified about this by means of a \c event notification,
 * which will only include the \c room and the updated participant as the
 * only object in a \c participants array.
 *
 * If you're the administrator of a room (that is, you created it and have access to the secret)
 * you can mute or unmute participants using the \c mute or \c unmute request
 *
 \verbatim
{
	"request" : "<mute|unmute, whether to mute or unmute >",
	"secret" : "<room secret, mandatory if configured>",
	"room" : <unique numeric ID of the room>,
	"id" : <unique numeric ID of the participant to kick>
}
\endverbatim
 *
 * A successful request will result in a success response:
 *
 \verbatim
{
	"audiobridge" : "success",
}
\endverbatim
 *
 * As anticipated, you can leave an audio room using the \c leave request,
 * which has to be formatted as follows:
 *
\verbatim
{
	"request" : "leave"
}
\endverbatim
 *
 * All the participants will receive an \c event notification with the
 * ID of the participant who just left:
 *
\verbatim
{
	"audiobridge" : "event",
	"room" : <numeric ID of the room>,
	"leaving" : <numeric ID of the participant who left>
}
\endverbatim
 *
 * For what concerns the \c changeroom request, instead, it's pretty much
 * the same as a \c join request and as such has to be formatted as follows:
 *
\verbatim
{
	"request" : "changeroom",
	"room" : <numeric ID of the room to move to>,
	"id" : <unique ID to assign to the participant; optional, assigned by the plugin if missing>,
	"display" : "<display name to have in the room; optional>",
	"token" : "<invitation token, in case the new room has an ACL; optional>",
	"muted" : <true|false, whether to start unmuted or muted>,
	"quality" : <0-10, Opus-related complexity to use, lower is higher quality; optional, default is 4>
}
\endverbatim
 *
 * Such a request will trigger all the above-described leaving/joined
 * events to the other participants, as it is indeed wrapping a \c leave
 * followed by a \c join and as such the other participants in both rooms
 * need to be updated accordingly. The participant who switched room
 * instead will be sent a \c roomchanged event which is pretty similar
 * to what \c joined looks like:
 *
 * A successful request will produce a \c joined event:
 *
\verbatim
{
	"audiobridge" : "roomchanged",
	"room" : <numeric ID of the new room>,
	"id" : <unique ID assigned to the participant in the new room>,
	"display" : "<display name of the new participant>",
	"participants" : [
		// Array of existing participants in the new room
	]
}
\endverbatim
 *
 * As a last note, notice that the AudioBridge plugin does support
 * renegotiations, mostly for the purpose of facilitating ICE restarts:
 * in fact, there isn't much need for renegotiations outside of that
 * context, as PeerConnections here will typically always contain a single
 * m-line for audio, and so adding/removing streams makes no sense; besides,
 * muting and unmuting is available via APIs, meaning that updating the
 * media direction via SDP renegotiations would be overkill.
 *
 * To force a renegotiation, all you need to do is send the new JSEP
 * offer together with a \c configure request: this request doesn't need
 * to contain any directive at all, and can be empty. A JSEP answer will
 * be sent back along the result of the request, if successful.
